# GMIT Multi-paradigm Programming "Shop Assignment"
The purpose of this assingment is to write a shop simulation using a procedural programming style in C, and the same project using an object oriented style in Java and then to compare the 2 paradigms.

In this repository you will find the C part in the file `c-shop`. The program is written in the file `shop.c`. 

As part of the project we were to provide different orders which may or may no be processible by the shop.

I have included 4 order.csv files as follows:
* order1.csv - the shop should be able to process this order (1 time)
* order2.csv - the total bill shouls exceed the customer budget - this will crash the program with an appropriate error
* order3.csv - has an item on the list that is not stocked - this will crash the proejct with an appropriate error
* order4.csv - orders more coke cans than are available - this will crash the proejct with an appropriate error

For the Java implementation:

I have included the project files in the `java-shop` folder. The project source code files are available in `/src` folder. I have also included copies of the 4 order files for the java implementation.

## Running the software

In order to run this software is is expected that you have an operation C compiler and Java compliler installed. The best way get the software installed is to clone it from Github as follows:

`git clone `
